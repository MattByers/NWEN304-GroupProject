NWEN 304 - Group Project - Online Shopping Service (for fruit)

How to start the service: The RESTful API can be started by executing the command "node index.js" from within the shopping-service folder in the hand-in directory. The service runs on port 8080 (if available) and can then be accessed by launching a web browser and going to "localhost:8080". Our shopping service is also available through Heroku at the address: "https://nwen304-shopping-service.herokuapp.com".

How to use the service: Our shopping service has 3 main tabs; Products, Login, Sign Up. Navigating to the Products page you can see all the fruit for sale and click on each of the fruit for more details and the ability to add a certain fruit to your cart. In order to add to the cart you must first have registered and logged in, which can by clicking either the Login or Sign Up buttons, depending on wether or not you have an account already. If you successfully log in you will see the Login and Register buttons change to Cart and Logout buttons. The service will automatically log you out if you're inactive for a period of 10 seconds. Once you have logged in and added all the items you want to your cart, you can navigate to the Cart page and see all the items in your cart and also remove items from your cart. Then finally you can Purchase all items.
