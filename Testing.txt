Test Cases for Client-End:



Test Cases for Caching:

The testing for cache control can be carried out in browser, using a developer console we can
load the index page and see that it has a max-age=86400 seconds, then after clicking on links
to other pages on the website we can see that the responses provide appropriate cacheControl
the product page itself has a max-age of just 3600 seconds, while the individual product pages
have a max-age of 28800 seconds, finally if logged in you can see the cart page is no-cached.
